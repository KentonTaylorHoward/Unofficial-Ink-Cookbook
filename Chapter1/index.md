# Chapter 1: Interactive Fiction and Narrative Games

Many long books have been written on the history of interactive fiction and narrative games. This chapter highlights some of the notable games and explains how Ink, and creating project using the narrative scripting language, fit into the larger community and historical context.

In this chapter, you will learn about the connection between interactive fiction and choose-you-own-adventure books, how nonlinear stories work, and the rise of the term of narrative games to describe projects that are similar to text-only games but have large graphical elements or parts.
Introduction to Interactive Fiction

Most of what we know of video games today had its roots in the games now called text-parsers. Playing the game consisted of entering and reading text. The first game of this genre was *Colossal Cave* (1977), a game about exploring a cave system. The term interactive fiction is often used for game like these because of their textual nature. Playing them was like reading a story where the reader (player) could direct the story along different paths. They could take a moment to explore an area, read more about something, or merely move around in the game.

All of the instructions to the game were also typed. When a player interacted with the fiction, they were reading and writing parts at the same time. They could take different actions and the game would respond accordingly based on how it was programmed.

## Choose Your Own Adventure!

Around the same time as *Colossal Cave* (1977), the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure (CYOA) series of books first started coming out. These books were not written to be read linear, page-by-page manner. Every few pages, the reader had to make a decision and then turn to a different page in the book where the story picked back up. Depending on the decisions made by the reader, they might even end up with a bad ending! 

Through working through the story, the reader was making choices of where they wanted to go next. While not always thought of in this sense, they were "interactive" fiction as well. They presented a way for a reader decide what to do next and the story supported those choices! The player had to turn pages and make decisions.

## Nonlinear Storytelling

As a more general term, nonlinear storytelling consists of these two aspects: making decisions and reacting to the consequences. Both *Colossal Cave* (1977) and the CYOA series of books are examples of how different mediums present these two aspects. When a reader or player interacts with the product, they are presented with choices. Choosing one sends them down one path or another in a story. Making choices and seeing different parts of the story are what make them nonlinear. Unlike other books, reading straight through a CYOA book would be no fun! Neither would seeing all the text of a game like *Colossal Cave* (1977) without also being about to play it through giving it commands of what to do next.

## Narrative Games

Early computers worked through users typing commands. They would type something, the computer would try to understand it, and then it would respond. Many of the games created in the 1980s up through the 1990s followed this same model: they used typing commands as the many source of player input in order to navigate digital worlds. Players would “play” through using a keyboard and typing out what they wanted to happen next.

As computer graphics improved, many games began to take the same nonlinear storytelling aspects of the earlier games and apply them in new ways. Decades after *Colossal Cave* (1977), large online games are possible through a number of different advances in graphical and communication technologies. Yet, at their root, many video games still have a heavier reliance on reading text and making choices, the central part of all nonlinear storytelling.

To help label games that may be more textual or graphical in nature, many people have used the term narrative games. These often refer to games that have deeper stories, ask players to read and understand aspects of the world, and then make choices about it. They share in the same lineage of Colossal Cave (1977), but use advanced graphics, online functionality, or multiplayer to convey their messages. 

## Ink Helps With Making Narrative Games?

Yes. Ink is called a "narrative scripting language." It was designed to create narrative game-like experiences through scripting different interactions in a language. Ink is a programming language created in order to help with the common problems of writing narrative games: giving the player choices, acting as a result of the player making a choice, and keeping track of information related to the game and choices made.

## Using Ink to Make More Complicated Projects

Many projects use Ink as their narrative or dialog system. Within a larger project with many interlocking and interdependent systems, Ink, and what it produces, can help writers construct a story that has multiple choices, paths, and outcomes for a player while other members of a team work with the finished product and interact with it through other tools like its Story API or the Unity Plugin. It is a tool designed to produce a file that can be read by other tools. As part of a toolchain, a collection of tools where the output of one feeds another, it works well as something in which a writer or developer can write and test the story in one tool and then use its output as part of a graphical system or other tools.

## What can you make with Ink?

Ink is designed to produce text-based projects. Inky, the editor covered in this book, is focused on writing text-heavy projects. It works best with projects that have choices and outcomes, and has been designed around handling how to connect what a user sees with how they interact with the game. 

That does not mean Ink has not been used in other, more graphical projects. *Heaven’s Vault* (2019), a game written in Ink and using the Unity game engine, was created by Inkle Studios, the inventor and maintainers of Ink. They integrate a story-rich game with animations, 3D models, and large worlds. Yet, its basis is in Ink itself, and their dialogue system, a central part of the game, is run directly from Ink.
